constructions to look at:

In part 1:
 + val/var
 + def
 + val override of def
 + lazy
 + class
 + case class
 + lambda
 + scala vs java namespaces
 + scala primary constructor vs java constructor
 + curried param lists
 + class extends trait
 + vs with trait
 - vs stacked traits
 + plain object
 + default parameters

In part 2:
 - class
 - trait
 - stackable trait
 - trait extends trait
 X trait extends interface
 - trait extends class
 - object with trait
 - object extends class
 - enum, and alternatives:
   - https://github.com/lloydmeta/enumeratum
 - pattern matching
 - for comprehension
 - implicits
   - regular type param
   - extension method
   - type conversion
   - type class
   - hlist
   - map over hlist
   - labelled generic

 - type alias
 - type member

 - type constraints
   - invarient, covarient, contravarient

scala constructor rules
 - in java, you have to call super first, means you can't use virtual functions as part of construction!

@ScalaSignature

 http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/6634.html

You need a ScalaSignatures in a class to:
1. compile against it
2. use Scala reflection (Java reflection obviously doesn't need it).

not sure how TASTY is being implemented

symbols that are vals, vars, and defs all inhabit the same namespace
 - very different than Java, where fields are separate from methods
